Custom Desktop App for Stair Layouts, DXF, Cut Lists, and G-Code (PyQt, CNC)

Summary
Build a Custom Desktop App to Automate Stair Layouts, Cut Lists, DXF, and G-Code (PyQt or Similar)

Description:

We're a stair manufacturing company looking to automate our stair design and CNC prep workflow. Right now, we use AutoCAD and Fusion 360 to manually generate layouts, cut lists, and DXF files for CNC stringer cutting.

We’re ready to build a custom Windows desktop application that:

Accepts user-defined stair parameters

Automatically calculates all stair geometry

Exports a printable layout PDF

Generates a cut list

Outputs DXF and G-code (stringers only, for a RichAuto CNC controller)

Provides a cost estimate with waste/labor markup

What We Need Built (Phase 1):

User-friendly interface (PyQt, PySide, or similar)

Input form for parameters like:

Total rise

Stair width

Tread thickness

Riser type

Nosing toggle

Landing height and dimensions

Auto-calculation of:

Rise/run

Number of treads and risers

Outputs:

Cut list (inches and sixteenths)

DXF file (for CNC router stringers)

G-code (RichAuto post, we’ll provide details)

PDF layout (matches our provided example exactly, 8.5" x 11", with company logo and job info)

Material cost estimate (per sheet/foot + waste buffer + labor markup)

Features:

Save/load jobs

Duplicate job button

Defaults for LSL, 1" treads, and nosing ON

Landing framing layout option

You’ll Get From Us:

Fully marked-up sample PDFs

Material prices and waste/labor formulas

Sample cut list formatting

G-code and DXF logic examples (RichAuto controller, ½” compression bit)

Our preferred layout format (179 Butterfly standard)

Fast feedback and real-world stair specs

Ideal Candidate:

Strong experience with PyQt/PySide or similar GUI frameworks

Can generate DXF and G-code (CNC woodworking experience preferred)

Skilled in PDF generation and layout formatting

Understands parametric design logic

Bonus if you’ve worked with AutoCAD, Fusion, or construction-based apps

Timeline:
Looking to start immediately. Phase 1 should be completed within 1–2 weeks depending on scope and responsiveness.

Budget:
We’re flexible for the right person — show us relevant samples and realistic timelines.

To apply:
Please share:

Examples of desktop tools you’ve built (especially for fabrication, manufacturing, CNC, CAD, or PDF/DXF generation)

Your experience with DXF or G-code generation (mention specific CNC machines if relevant)

How soon you can start

We’ll prioritize fast communication and clear samples over long resumes.
