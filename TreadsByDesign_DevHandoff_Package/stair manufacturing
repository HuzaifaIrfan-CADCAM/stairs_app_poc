The app should accept simple stair inputs (total rise, width, nosing toggle, etc.) and generate:

📄 Branded 8.5x11 PDF cut lists

📐 DXF framing layout

🧰 G-code for CNC (RichAuto controller, ½" compression bit)

The app must include:

PyQt (or Tkinter) GUI

1/16" precision output

PDF stamping with our company logo and job name

Material cost estimator (with markup and waste buffer)

All assets are ready (mockups, specs, sample PDFs, cut list logic). We’re starting with a basic prototype and expanding from there.
